# Apple SQA Assignment

I received this assignment as part of my application to an SQA position at Apple a few months back. Certainly, there are far better/easier ways of doing this using existing packages, but I thought I'd have some fun with it.

### Instructions:
There are 5 directories in `HomeWork`; each directory contains a file named `fruit.log`.  
- The log files contain continuous time based logs.  
- The directory names have been arbitrarily assigned and do not represent the data in order of time.  
- We want to reassemble the original `fruit.log` file in date/time order.  
  
Please code a solution (In PYTHON) that reassembles the original `fruit.log` file in proper time order. Once the file is assembled, get the value of the `Kiwi`.  Find the `min`, `max`, and `average` of this value and print it out. Lastly, write all of the test cases, both positive and negative that you would use to test your program.
